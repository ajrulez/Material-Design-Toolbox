# Material Design Toolbox

*_This library is still a work in progress._*

The main purpose of this library is to provide components and helper methods in implementing [Material Design concepts](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) with little to no effort. This library in particular focuses on components that are not yet included in Google's support libraries, with most widgets adhering very closely to the guidelines Google has set. Links to already-existing components will be provided.

As this library reaches closer to completion, it will be published on JCenter.  

This library supports Android 4.0 (API 15) and up, however, not all components/methods will be supported pre-API 21.

## Components  

### [Toolbars](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/toolbars.html)  

The [`Toolbar`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/Toolbar.html) widget is part of the `appcompat-v7` support library.

### [Tooltips](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/tooltips.html)  

Tooltips (extends `TextView`) are similar to [`Toasts`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html), both in appearance and in function. Creating a `Tooltip` is very similar to creating a `Toast` or `Snackbar`:

```java
Tooltip.makeTooltip(context, "Tooltip text", Tooltip.LENGTH_SHORT, anchorView).show();
```  

The arguments passed in are a `Context`, string text (or a string resource), a duration of how long you want the `Tooltip` to appear (`LENGTH_SHORT` or `LENGTH_LONG`), and a `View` to anchor the `Tooltip` on. By default, the `Tooltip` will appear below the anchor, unless the anchor is low enough on the screen, then the `Tooltip` will instead appear above the anchor.
